## My process

I coded basic structure of my flipping cards and then I started to search how to implement java script timer logic. I found it quite hard and I had to reuse some of [crsimpson5](https://github.com/crsimpson5/launch-countdown-timer/blob/main/script.js) code.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Code time: 8,5 hours.

I learned how to change my transform origin and how perspective works. I set my timer for the first time with setHours/getHours function.

In addition I learned about .padStart from [crsimpson5](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/responsive-countdown-timer-made-using-vanilla-js-sass-3wnMC395Zn) code. His JS logic has helped me a lot.
